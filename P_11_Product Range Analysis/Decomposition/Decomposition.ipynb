    "#### Who's is our customers?\n",
    "The primary reason why individuals choose to shop online instead of in-person is either to save time or due to limited spare time. It is important to note that the majority of household goods are considered necessities rather than luxuries.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a result, it is essential to understand the buyer persona of the target audience, which typically consists of busy homeowners who require essential goods but have limited time to shop. However, there may be some differences in the circumstances of these customers, such as requiring several items after moving, replacing worn-out items at a more leisurely pace, or urgently needing to replace an item.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What needs to be achieved and why?\n",
    "\n",
    "To maximize customer satisfaction and drive sales growth, it is crucial to evaluate the performance of each product in a logical and unbiased manner to ensure they meet customer needs. This evaluation should include comparing individual product performance with that of the entire product range.\n",
    "\n",
    "To achieve this, it is important to obtain an accurate understanding of the current state of the product range and identify any trends. This analysis should begin by examining the product range at a high-level categorization and then drill down to specific products. Throughout this process, it is crucial to consistently compare the average metric value for the group of products with the corresponding metric value at the individual product level.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What decisions will be made based on the analysis?\n",
    "\n",
    "The analysis can aid in making decisions regarding keeping, replacing, or removing a product based on its performance. By identifying the best-performing products and removing or replacing the underperforming ones, businesses can optimize their product offerings, increase revenue, and enhance customer satisfaction.\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, we can offer substitute products when a product is out of stock, prepare for seasonal boosts in sales during specific times and dates, and make other data-driven decisions to improve their overall performance."
